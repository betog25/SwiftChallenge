In the programming language of your choice, write a program that counts from 0
to 100, prints "Fizz" every time the count is a multiple of 3, prints "Buzz"
every time the count is a multiple of 5, and prints the count otherwise. Bonus
points if you add testing, documentation, and/or upload your code to GitHub.
